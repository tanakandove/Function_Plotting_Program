 # Progress Report
### Due: Saturday December 10 at 11:59 PM

This file will contain your Progress Report. Answer the prompts below to evaluate how well you were able to meet your intermediate goal(s).

### In a numbered list, briefly restate the intermediate goal(s) from your Project Proposal.
1. Look into python module/s I can use for graphing. How do I plot different graphs on the same axis? Also look into appropiate scale and size of the axis. 
2. What is the best way to get input from the user and validates the values? How to catch different value error since I'm getting a lot of values from the user?
3. Best menu design that does not confuse the user. 
4. Look into data structures combinations to store values a, b, c of the different graphs selected by the user.
   
### Which goal(s) were you able to acheieve?
1. I'm using matplotlib, numpy and math modules to plot the graphs. I managed to plot the different grahps on the same axis with different colors. 
2. I'm using input function to get values from the user. User will be asked to enter the numbers and if one enters characters or punctuation characters, the program will exit.
3. I used a menu similar to the one we used in one of the labs in class. The user can select up to 4 graphs, but if they want to plot graphs less than 4, they input an empty string after selecting the options of graphs they want to plot.
4. I'm using a nested list to store values from the user, values for plotting the graphs. The list starts as an empty list then builds a nested list as the user selects graphs to plot and enters the values for plotting the graphs.  

### Which goal(s) were you not able to acheieve? 
#### Please describe what problem(s) you faced, and indicate if you are still stuck on any particular step.
1. How to customize the size of the axis based on the user plotting points; for example, tangent graph has large scale so when plotted together with other graphs like cos or sin, the sin or cos graph will be small. It is hard to make sense out of the graphs e.g point of intersection. How do I put a limit on the size of the axis? For example, saying the maximum value in the y_axis is +10 and the minimum value is -10. 

### In a few sentences, descibe your next steps.
1. Check accuracy of the graphs in terms of slope, amplitude and period. I will compare my outputs with those I get from Desmos. 
2. Customizing size of the scale of the axis based on the user plotting points.
3. Putting labels for the axis.

# Feedback

It sounds like you've made some good progress!  Good luck with the rest of your project.  I'm excited to see the final product.
