 # Project Proposal
### Due: Thursday December 1 at 11:59 PM

This file will contain your Final Project Proposal. Answer the prompts below to outline your project. If you are struggling to think of ideas, refer to the [Project Overview](https://cs.oberlin.edu/~cs150/final-project/part-1/) for suggestions.

### What is the title of your project?
Mini Graphing Calculator. 

### In 3-5 sentences, summarize what you want to accomplish. Provide enough detail so that I can understand your main idea, but try to keep things concise.
Provides a user menu with four kinds of graphs: y = asin(bx)+c, y = atan(bx)+c, y = acos(bx)+c, and y = ax+b. Based on the user's choice, ask for the variables: a, b, c. The user can select up to 4 graphs. Ask user again for the next input until the user enters a blank input or reaches 4 grahps. Plot the graphs selected by the user in different colors on a single graph/axis. 

### In a numbered list, briefly describe your intermediate goal(s).
#### Note that you will reflect on how well you were able to meet your intermediate goal(s) in your Progress Report.
1. Look into python module/s I can use for graphing. How do I plot different graphs on the same axis? Also look into appropiate scale and size of the axis. 
2. What is the best way to get input from the user and validates the values? How to catch different value error since I'm getting a lot of values from the user?
3. Best menu design that does not confuse the user. 
4. Look into data structures combinations to store values a, b, c of the different graphs selected by the user.
   
# Feedback

This project sounds really interesting!  I'm looking forward to seeing what you create.  If you have any questions as you are working on it, please let me know.

matplotlib might be one python library that could be helpful, but I'm guessing there are also others.
